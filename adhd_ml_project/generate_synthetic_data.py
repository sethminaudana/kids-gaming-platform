# --- GENERATE FEATURES FOR NEUROTYPICAL (NON-ADHD) PROFILE ---
# Neurotypical children tend to be consistent (low std dev) and have good impulse control.

# 1. Average Click Speed (ms)
# Normal distribution: Average 1200ms per click, +/- 200ms variation
avg_speed = np.random.normal(loc=1200, scale=200, size=NUM_SAMPLES)

# 2. Consistency (Standard Deviation) - CRITICAL FEATURE
# Neurotypicals are steady. Their variance is usually low (e.g., 200-400ms)
# We use a Gamma distribution because variance can't be negative
consistency = np.random.gamma(shape=2.0, scale=150, size=NUM_SAMPLES)

# 3. Invalid Clicks (Impulsivity)
# Neurotypicals rarely click locked boards. Using Poisson distribution (low count).
# Mostly 0, 1, or 2 clicks.
invalid_clicks = np.random.poisson(lam=1.5, size=NUM_SAMPLES)

# 4. Reflexive Fast Clicks (<200ms)
# Very rare for neurotypicals to click faster than human reaction time.
reflexive_clicks = np.random.poisson(lam=0.5, size=NUM_SAMPLES)

# 5. Mouse Distance
# Neurotypicals usually plan moves, so distance is moderate.
# Correlated with speed (faster players might move mouse less efficiently)
mouse_distance = (avg_speed * 3) + np.random.normal(0, 500, NUM_SAMPLES)

# 6. Total Errors (Working Memory)
# Average of 4-8 errors per game for a normal child
errors = np.random.poisson(lam=6, size=NUM_SAMPLES)

# 7. Total Score (NEW)
# Since the game finishes when all 8 pairs are found, the score is 8.
# We make it an array of 8s.
scores = np.full(NUM_SAMPLES, 8)
