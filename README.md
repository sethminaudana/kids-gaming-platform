> **Bridging the gap between clinical psychology and interactive technology.**

## 📖 Project Overview

**[Project Name]** is a research based software solution designed to screen for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using gamification techniques. Unlike traditional paper-based questionnaires, this tool utilizes interactive gameplay to measure attention span, impulsivity, and reaction times in a stress-free environment.

This project was developed as a comprehensive research initiative to determine if gamified metrics can correlate with standard DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

* **Visual Feedback:** Engaging UI to keep users focused during the assessment.

### 📊 Diagnostic Analytics
* **Real-time Scoring:** Instant calculation of performance metrics.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Compare user results against control group baselines.
* **Detailed Reports:** Generates PDF reports for clinicians/researchers.

### 🛡️ User Management
* **Role-Based Access:** Separate dashboards for Admins, Researchers, and Users.
* **Secure Data:** Anonymized data storage for research integrity.
* **JWT Authentication:** Secure login for Admins, Researchers, and Users.
* **NoSQL Data Structure:** Flexible schema for storing complex gameplay logs.

## 🔬 Research Methodology

This tool operates on a specific set of psychological parameters:

1.  **Sustained Attention:** Measured by the user's ability to track targets over time.
2.  **Inhibition Control:** Measured by "Go/No-Go" gameplay mechanics.
3.  **DSM-5 Integration:** Game results are cross-referenced with digital questionnaire inputs.
